//? 1) Creating a new react project

// --> Create a new directory
// --> Open in VS code
// --> Open the terminal for the current directory
// --> Type "npm create vite@latest"
// --> Give the project name in small case with only hi-fins and not even underscores
// --> Select "React" as framework and "Javascript" as variant
// --> Then a directory with our project name and a "package.json" file will be created inside it (along with other files)
// --> Go inside the directory in the terminal, type "npm i" to install the node_modules
